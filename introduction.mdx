## Overview

Osprey Demo provides a comprehensive suite of geotechnical and structural instrumentation solutions for the civil and resources sectors. You can use these monitoring tools to automate manual processes, simplify installation, and reduce overall costs. The documentation space helps you organize project details, access product guides, and manage data effectively.

Key products include the Osprey Tilt String (`OTS`) for distributed tilt measurements and the In-Place Extensometer (`IPX`) for precise strain monitoring. These instruments support applications from diaphragm walls and pipelines to railways and retaining walls.
